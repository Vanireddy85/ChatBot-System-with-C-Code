# ChatBot-System-with-C-Code

About Project

Talking about the project, this is a simple example of AI. The concept here used is AIML. This is an XML version for writing AI codes. Here whenever you put your question, then the system will look for the set of pre-defined questions from the AIML pattern. If it finds questions matching its pattern, then it will return a positive response and will answer. Suppose you ask it for like tell its name, then it will say hey I am ChatBot. But if your question goes out of bound or says out of the range, then it will reply with something different behaving that it does not know what you are asking for it. This whole concept uses the AI and aiml algorithm. It can be beneficial for your websites where users ask for so many things.
